1. Dependency Directories (CRITICAL)
This folder contains all the external libraries (like React and Firebase)
which are huge. These are downloaded automatically using 'npm install'.
/node_modules

2. Build Outputs (CRITICAL)
These folders contain files generated by the Vite build process.
They are temporary and shouldn't be tracked.
/dist
/build
.vite
.parcel-cache

3. Local Environment and Secrets
Although you manually put your keys in config.js,
it's best practice to ignore typical environment variable files.
.env
.env.local
.env.*.local

4. Logs and Cache
Generated logs and cache files that aren't necessary for the code.
logs
.log
npm-debug.log
yarn-debug.log*

5. Operating System/Editor Files
Files created by your computer or VS Code that are not code.
.DS_Store # Mac operating system files
Thumbs.db # Windows operating system files
.vscode/*
!.vscode/settings.json # Exclude specific VS Code files you might want to share
